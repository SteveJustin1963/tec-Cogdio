# tec-Cogni-io
Builds on the https://github.com/SteveJustin1963/tec-LACE project to create controlled cognitive links to form mental mesh between multiple humans, over radio or point to point hook up.

The consequences of forming mental mesh links between multiple humans as a shared conscience are not fully known. However, it is possible that this could lead to a more efficient use of the available spectrum and to improved communication between humans. Building telepathy is an interesting idea, but it is not clear how this would be possible. It is possible that telepathy could be used to communicate thoughts or ideas between humans. Cognitive radio links are links between multiple humans that are controlled by a cognitive radio system. This system is designed to manage the interference between multiple links and to optimize the use of the available spectrum. The cognitive radio system is able to identify the best frequency for each link and to switch between frequencies as needed to maintain the link quality.

The concept of learning itself is also an example of cognition. This is about the way in which the brain makes connections while remembering what is learned. The ability to reason logically is an excellent example of cognition, problem solving and making judgments about information.
