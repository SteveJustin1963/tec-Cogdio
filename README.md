# tec-LACE-LINK

Builds on the https://github.com/SteveJustin1963/tec-LACE project to create controlled mental links to form mental bridges or meshes between multiple humans, over radio or point to point hook up.

The consequences of forming mental mesh links between multiple humans as a shared conscience are not fully known. However, it is possible that this could lead to a more efficient use of the available spectrum and to improved communication between humans. Its like building telepathy, but it is not clear how this the details work. It is possible that telepathy could be used to communicate thoughts or ideas between humans. Cognitive radio links are links between multiple humans that are controlled by a cognitive radio system. This system is designed to manage the interference between multiple links and to optimize the use of the available spectrum. The cognitive radio system is able to identify the best frequency for each link and to switch between frequencies as needed to maintain the link quality.

If and when a link is made to another persons mind hyper-cognition (...the power to perform complex mental operations drastically beyond what is naturally possible) may occur, a collective growing experience of cognition. Its more about higher thought, to reason deeply and logically, problem solving and making judgments about information may execute on a higher plane and regulate ones own cognitive activity.

There was a sci-fi movie called Brainstorm (1983) where scientists invent a brainâ€“computer interface enabling sensations and emotional feelings to be recorded from a person's brain and converted to tape for others to experience with often serious and dangerous effects. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainstorm_(1983_film)


## Lab Plan:
## Objective:
To build upon the existing tec-LACE project and develop a controlled mental link system to form mental bridges or meshes between multiple humans, over radio or point-to-point connection.
## Methods:
Utilize cognitive radio technology to manage interference between multiple links and optimize the use of the available spectrum.
Develop a system that can identify the best frequency for each link and switch between frequencies as needed to maintain link quality.
Conduct experiments to test the feasibility of forming mental mesh links between multiple humans and measure the effects on communication and cognitive abilities.
Monitor for any potential negative consequences and implement measures to mitigate them.
## Expected Results:
Successful development of a controlled mental link system that allows for communication and shared consciousness between multiple individuals.
Improved communication and potential enhancement of cognitive abilities through the formation of mental mesh links.
Identification of any potential negative consequences and development of measures to mitigate them.
## Risks:
The consequences of forming mental mesh links between multiple humans as a shared conscience are not fully known and may have negative effects.
The technology may not be feasible and may not work as expected.
## Note: 
it is important to consider ethical and legal implications of this technology before proceeding with any experimentation on human subjects.

## Iterate
